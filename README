Description
===========

bmpit allows one to generate an image from any file by prepending a (mostly)
valid bmp header to it.

This allows further interpretation of the content of the file. For exemple,
strings are easily spotted by looking for zones with 1-pixel wide vertical
lines, whereas html parts are shown by "waves" fluctuating in a zone.

It's actually kind of cool to discover it yourself ;)

For further interpretation see: http://crucialsecurityblog.harris.com/

Usage
=====

Usage: bmpit.py [-h] [-H height] [-W width] [-o offset] INPUT [OUTPUT]

Arguments:
    INPUT            The file to bmp
    OUTPUT           Output file, default is it.bmp

Options:
    -h, --help       Print this help and exit
    -H height        Height in pixel
    -W width         Width in pixel
    -o offset        Offset reading the source file in bytes

Warning
=======

It does not work very well on big files such as videos, you may see a black
part at the beginning that seems endless. If that happens, you can try
playing with the width of the image.
